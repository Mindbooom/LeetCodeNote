## Descrition
有n盏初始状态为关着的灯，n个人依次操作。第i个人，将i倍数的灯状态改变。开改为关或者关改为开。输出最后开的灯编号。

## Solution
```C++
#include <iostream>
#include<math.h>
using namespace std;

int main(){
    int n;
    cin>>n;
    for(int i =1;i<=n;i++)
    {
        float temp = sqrt(i);
        if(int(temp)==temp)
            cout<<i<<endl;
    }
    return 0 ;
}
```

## Thought
Firstly, try to write some cases. For instance, from 1 to 15. You can find that  1 and prime number lead to light off and square numbers 
result in light on. And any other numbers lead to light off. 
So, we can reduce the situations as when a number is a square number which means its square root is integer we print light on.
