## Description :
Evaluate the value of an arithmetic expression in Reverse Polish Notation.

Valid operators are +, -, *, /. Each operand may be an integer or another expression.

Note:

Division between two integers should truncate toward zero.
The given RPN expression is always valid. That means the expression would always evaluate to a result and there won't be any divide by zero operation.

Example 1:
<br>
Input: ["2", "1", "+", "3", "*"]
Output: 9
Explanation: ((2 + 1) * 3) = 9
<br>
Example 2:
<br>
Input: ["4", "13", "5", "/", "+"]
Output: 6
Explanation: (4 + (13 / 5)) = 6
<br>
Example 3:
<br>
Input: ["10", "6", "9", "3", "+", "-11", "*", "/", "*", "17", "+", "5", "+"]
Output: 22
Explanation: 
  ((10 * (6 / ((9 + 3) * -11))) + 17) + 5
= ((10 * (6 / (12 * -11))) + 17) + 5
= ((10 * (6 / -132)) + 17) + 5
= ((10 * 0) + 17) + 5
= (0 + 17) + 5
= 17 + 5
= 22

## Solution:
```c++
#include<stack>
class Solution {
public:
    int evalRPN(vector<string>& tokens) {
        int x;
        int y;
        int temp;
        stack<int>sta;
        for(auto&& str : tokens)
        {
            if(str!="+"&&str!="-"&&str!="*"&&str!="/")// the next char is a number
            sta.push(atoi(str.c_str()));
            else// the next char is an operator
             {
                 y = sta.top();
                 sta.pop();
                 x = sta.top();
                 sta.pop();
                 switch(str[0])
                 {
                     case '+':
                     temp = x+y;
                     break;
                     case '-':
                     temp = x-y;
                     break;
                     case '*':
                     temp = x*y;
                     break;
                     case '/':
                     temp = x/y;
                     break;
                 }
                sta.push(temp);
            }

            
        }
        int res = sta.top();
            return res;

    }
            
};

```
## Thought:
This problem is not difficult but has many details to be noticed. 
For example, when controlling the condition of circulation. Both of auto&& and stack.empty*() is all right. However, adopting the first
one can avoid some other problems such as the the stack is empty when beginning. <br>
And I find it almost impossible to avoid using switch because the ASCII code of operator cannot be used not like the int and char.
Besides, the translation among string, char and int is significant for C++ users.
